# Hands-on

#### Create A Git Repo

Before we make commits or do anything else with a git repository, the repo needs to actually exist. To create a new repository with Git, we'll use the ```git init``` command.

The init subcommand is short for "initialize", which is helpful because it's the command that will do all of the initial setup of a repository.

**Other useful commands:**

ls - used to list files and directories
mkdir - used to create a new directory
cd - used to change directories
rm - used to remove files and directories
pwd - print working directory

#### Create Course Directories

Enter the desired working directory using ```cd``` command

create a directory ABC (udacity-git-course), inside that, create another directory called XYZ (new-git-project)
use the cd command to move into the new-git-project directory

Run the below command in the cmd
```- mkdir -p udacity-git-course/new-git-project && cd $_ ```
